# Feature Pyramid Networks for Object Detection

> Tsung-Yi Lin; Facebook AI Research (FAIR)





## Background
- Detecting objects in __different scales__ is challenging in particular for small objects.
- We can use a pyramid of the same image at different scale to detect objects.
- Feature maps closer to the image layer composed of low-level structures that are not effective for accurate object detection.


**FPN is a good feature extractor designed for such pyramid concept with accuracy and speed in mind.**
